Your index and show templates should inherit from the base template and not have the duplicate boilerplate HTML stuff;  at the top of your index template, for example, you should be able to say `{% extends 'base.html' %}` and then just override block(s) as appropriate from the base.  

Everything works well and looks good; just the template inheritance needs to be fixed.
